# bone-age-assessment

This project aims to estimate the **bone age** of children using **hand X-ray images** and compare it with their chronological age to help diagnose growth-related conditions or detect inconsistencies in reported age (e.g., in immigration or sports registration).

---

## Problem Statement

Bone age assessment is a clinical task used to evaluate the maturity of a child's skeletal system. Automating this process using deep learning can:
- Assist doctors in diagnosing growth disorders (e.g., delayed growth).
- Identify children using false ages in contexts like illegal immigration or sports clubs.

## Dataset & Preprocessing

We used a publicly available dataset of **hand X-ray images**.  
We applied several **image preprocessing techniques** including:
- **CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)** for enhancing contrast.

---

## Deep Learning Models Used

We experimented with multiple models and input types to find the best architecture:

### 1. Xception Model

- **Single Input**: Hand X-ray image only  
- **Multi Input**: Hand X-ray image + Gender  

ðŸŸ¢ **Best Results were achieved by this model (Multi-Input):**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** 8.5
- **RÂ² Score:** 0.93

---

### 2. ResNet-50 Model

- **Single Input**: Hand X-ray image only  
- **Multi Input**: Hand X-ray image + Gender  

These models were also trained and evaluated for comparison, but the Xception-based model outperformed them.

---

## User Interface

We built an interactive demo using **Gradio** that allows users to upload a hand X-ray and specify gender to get the predicted bone age.
